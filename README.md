Assumptions:
- The order of priority for the seating is based on the reservation numbers
    - e.g. R001 has higher priority than R002
- If a reservation requires more than 20 seats, then it can not be placed as there are only 20 seats per row. 
- Row J has the "best" seats as it is the furthest from the screen and Row A has the "worst"seats as it is closest to the screen.
